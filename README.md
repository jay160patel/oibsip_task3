## üèóÔ∏è Steps Performed  

### 1. Data Loading  
- Loaded the wine quality dataset (e.g., red and white wine data).  
- Inspected the dataset for completeness and consistency.  

### 2. Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values and outliers.  
- Standardized and normalized numerical features for better model performance.  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analyzed feature distributions and correlations.  
- Visualized relationships between features and wine quality using heatmaps, pair plots, and box plots.  

### 4. Feature Engineering  
- Selected the most significant features based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge.  
- Created new features or transformed existing ones to improve model input quality.  

### 5. Model Training  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
- Trained machine learning models such as:  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **Gradient Boosting**  
- Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.  

### 6. Model Evaluation  
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like:  
  - **Accuracy**  
  - **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**  
  - **Confusion Matrix**  
- Compared the performance of different models to select the best one.  

### 7. Data Visualization  
- Plotted actual vs. predicted quality scores.  
- Visualized feature importance to understand which factors most influence wine quality.
